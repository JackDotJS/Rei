### To Do

- expand on startup event (ping, status, etc)
- extensive error logging/reporting (important)
- custom icons (just nice to have tbh)
- role reacts (!important)
  

# Hello!

__ This is my (Sen) Discord bot __

- the source is comprehensible, and in plain JS (ESM used, be aware)
- it can do moderation
- it can do funny stuff
- it can NOT cook you a pie

but it DOES have:

- multi-server config & database
- funny ping reactions (only redeeming factor in this codebase)

# Why though?

- i wanted something to do at work.

Feel free to copy the entire source code. It's on here for a reason :3
